How to run the program: make then use ./oss When you are finished with the program 

Deadlock detection algorithm was found on GeeksForGeeks and troubleshooted using StackOverflow

Known Issues: The seconds in the logfile (output) are not incrementing properly. Shared memory segments and semaphores are not being deallocated properly, I could not find a fix for this. There is no verbose option in the project, the table is at the bottom of the logfile (output), so you will have to page down to get to it.
